Given an array of `strings`, return an array of arrays such that all anagrams are grouped together.
Two strings are anagrams if they have the same frequency of letters

(Ex. "ninjaprep", "prepninja" and "janinppre" are anagrams because they have the same frequency of letters)

##### Example 1

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["cat", "tac", "atc", "sam"]
<b>Expected Output:</b> [["cat", "tac", "atc"], ["sam"]]
</pre>

##### Example 2

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["abcd", "dbca", "bcad", "aabc"]
<b>Expected Output:</b> [["abcd", "dbca", "bcad"], ["aabc"]]
</pre>
