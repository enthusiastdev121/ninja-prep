Given an array of `integers`, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

An increasing subsequence is a subsequence of an array that is strictly increasing

Return an `integer` that is the length of the longest increasing subsequence

##### Example 1

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [312, 14, 22, 1, 20, 83, 2]]
<b>Expected Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest increasing subsequence is [1, 20, 83].
Notice how these numbers are strictly increasing

##### Example 2

<pre>
<b>Target:</b> 12
<b>Input:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
<b>Expected Output:</b> 5
